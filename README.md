# Welcome to the Seasons of Serverless!

Every year around the holiday season, Dominique and Simone's friends eagerly look forward to their annual holiday friend potluck. This year, since they can't meet in person to share food and company, they're trying something new: a virtual potluck!
 
Each of their friends is going to be presenting a home-cooked dish or group of dishes from their holiday traditions and culture that's meaningful to them. Each week, you can log on to the Seasons of Serverless site to solve another unique code challenge presented by one of Dominique and Simone's friends and focused on a culinary tradition from around the world.

## Challenge 1: The Perfect Turkey ü¶É

**Featured Region: North America**

**Your Chefs: Jen Looper, Cloud Advocate (Microsoft) and Darren Butler and Eric Yu, Microsoft Student Ambassadors**

Here in North America, many families believe that the holidays are simply not complete without a proper turkey on the table. [Learn more about this challenge](Nov-23-2020.md).

## Main Goal

Each year at this time, we prepare something special to help you learn Serverless once and for all with a series of challenges. This year, we decided to feature seven unique challenges, one per week. Come join us!

## Rules

1. Solve each [coding challenge](#challenges) in the week it gets published.

2. Tweet your progress during the challenge period using the hashtag [#SeasonsOfServerless](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SeasonsOfServerless).

3. Submit the code of your solution as an Issue to this repository before the sample solution gets published (7 days after the challenge is published).

4. You may get picked for a mention on social media. If you submit an Issue you agree that we mention your name and/or nicknames (GitHub, Twitter) publicly in the context of Seasons of Serverless.
